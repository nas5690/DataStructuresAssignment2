# DataStructuresAssignment2
Second assignment of Data Structures class

P-1.26: 
Write a short Java program that takes all the lines input to standard input and writes them to standard output
in reverse order. That is, each line is output in the correct order, but the ordering of the lines is reversed.


P-2.34: 
Define a Polygon interface that has methods area() and perimeter(). Then implement classes for Triangle, 
Quadrilateral, Pentagon, Hexagon, and Octagon, which implement this interface, with the obvious meanings for 
the area() and perimeter() methods. Also implement classes, IsoscelesTriangle, EquilateralTriangle, Rectangle,
and Square, which have the appropriate inheritance relationships. Finally, write a simple user interface, which
allows users to create polygons of the various types, input their geometric dimensions, and then output their
area and perimeter. For extra effort, allow users to input polygons by specifying their vertex coordinates and
be able to test if two such polygons are similar. 


P-2.35: 
Write a Java program that inputs a list of words, separated by whitespace, and outputs how many times each word
appears in the list.
